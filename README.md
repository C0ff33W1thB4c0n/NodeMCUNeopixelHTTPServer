## About this project

This autumn I built a bar with counter made of euro pallets in my garden shed. This counter of course
needed some pretty RGB lights, so I built some with an ESP8266 NodeMCU I had lying around and a
Neopixel RGB strip. I wantet to connect the esp to my WiFi in order to change the colours with my phone.

So I needed an app for my android phone...
